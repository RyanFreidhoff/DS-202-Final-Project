Data Science 202 Final Project GitHub Repository

This project is aimed at disecting a custom Spotify playlist. The goal will be to find strong correlations between songs in the playlist, and make note of any minor detials discovered thorughout the process. The data has been created by hand and loaded in as a .csv file. The data will then be loaded into R as a dataframe at which point certain calculated columns will be added and the correlations between the dimensions of data will be found. A bulk of this project will be oriented towards articulating all findings in the form of different visualizations and summaries.
