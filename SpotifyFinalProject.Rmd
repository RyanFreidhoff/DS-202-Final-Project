Title: Spotify Data Final Project
Group: Jonah Landas, Ryan Freidhoff
Data: Data is from a playlist I have made on Spotify. The data contains year each song was produced, duration, artist name, album name, song name, if it is a one-hit-wonder (Y/N), popularity rating, type of release, and genre.
Questions: Can we profile the playlist to see exactly what the typical song looks like? What are the strongest correlations within these songs, and what exactly is the backbone of a playlist?

```{r}
  library(rvest)

  spotify <- read_csv("DS 202 Final Project - Data(Sheet1).csv")
  head(spotify)
